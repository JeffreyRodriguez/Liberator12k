# Introduction

Welcome to the \#Liberator12k project.
This manual will guide you through the build process.

Chat with me and other builders! 
**\#liberator12k:matrix.org** on [Element](https://element.io)

## The [Liberator12k.com](https://liberator12k.com/store/) Store
The official store has complete hardware kits.

All the hardware in the project is fairly easy to source yourself.

### International Builders
This is a US-based operation. I'm not presently shipping internationally.
That means I won't knowingly ship to a forwarder, either.

I think it's a much more legally complex issue that has a higher chance of
getting me arrested over something I didn't know.

Join the chat, there's other builders around the world. There's a metric version
but it's less well documented.

## Support the Project
This one-man operation cost tens of thousands of dollars and years of my time.
I'm giving it away for free because I want to support your ability to defend
yourself. I think that makes me safer, and the world better overall.
If you want to show your appreciation and help me continue this work
here's how you can help.

### Official Kits!
It would be trivial for someone to come along and sell the same hardware kit.
I'm asking you - the community - to support the official project.

I didn't start this to get rich, but I wouldn't mind a little support.
If it pays well enough I'd love to make new guns and ECM machines full-time.

### Partners
I don't need to be the guy making and selling kits, I'd much rather spend my
time in R&D.. but I have to fund it somehow.

Manufacturing is not my field and I'm open to endorsing quality manufacturers
and distributors for a royalty. If you'd like to support the project as a
partner, get in touch. The requirements are straight forward and good business.

### Donations
Direct Bitcoin contributions are welcome.
Check the [Donation page](https://liberator12k.com/donate.html) on the website
for full details.

At the time of this writing, I have a
[Patreon](https://patreon.com/liberator12k).
It's a soft target for the authoritarians, but for now it's an easy way to help.

## How to Laugh at Danger
From behind a solid barrier - don't be stupid.
Everyone's a tough guy until they take a piece of shrapnel to the beanbag.

### Make at Your Own Risk
Any experienced printer can complete this build if they buy a kit from me.
I have done my best to make sure the designs included here are safe to the user
and bystanders. Designs that are in "Alpha" *may not be safe* to the user
**or bystanders.** Use extreme caution and two doses of common sense.

### Bystander Care
It's one thing if you hurt yourself, it's another if you hurt someone else.
The revolver will throw shot/wadding from the gap - at your range neighbors.
Keep bystanders behind you and maintain a safe "180 degree" line or
I'll shake *their* hand for kicking your ass, because you were warned.

### Basic Firearms Safety
 1. All guns are always loaded. 
 2. Never point the gun at anything you are not willing to destroy 
 3. Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on target and you have made the decision to shoot.
 4. Be sure of your target and what is beyond it.

### DIY Safety
DIY guns require special precautions and procedures that
*are not fully documented here*.

* Use a secure test rig to hold the gun pointed in a **safe direction**.
* Stand behind a bulletproof barrier, such as several feet of dirt, concrete blocks, or very large tree.
* Ensure there is no direct path from the gun to anyone or anything of value.
* A string long enough to pull the trigger from behind cover.
* Test with at least 5 of the highest pressure cartridges you can find.

### Gut Check
The power to create weapons is now in your hands, use it responsibly.

## Equipment
You print and can assemble the official kit with a few basic tools. Reamers are
recommended for the plastics.

If you intend to DIY everything, you'll need a few more tools and equipment.
There's not a lot of "machining" required - a couple tapped holes in flat plate
and square rods. Contouring the recoil plate with a grinder would suck, but it
can be done.

I would strongly recommend a drill press if you're doing it all yourself, but
you can probably get by with some printed fixtures and jigs. Not ideal, but
it'll work.

A cold saw or metal band saw are ideal for cutting the tubing and rods to size.
A lathe would be great for truing up pipes and tubes, but you can get by
with a grinder, belt/disc sander, or files in a pinch.

### Metric and Inch
In the US it's sometimes easier and *much* cheaper to find certain parts in
metric measurements. Most things are inch-standard, but there are "close enough"
metric equivalents that are readily available.

In general, here's how things go between inch and mm in this project:

| Purpose       | Inch    | Metric |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| Small pins    | 3/32"   | 2.5mm  |
| Medium Pins   | 1/4"    | 6mm    |
| Small Screws  | \#8-32  | M4     |
| Medium Screws | 1/4"-20 | M6     |
| Large Screws  | 1/2"-13 | 12mm   |
| Square Rods   | 1/4"    | 6mm    |

A \#39 drill bit is just over 2.5mm - both are acceptable clearance
drill bits for small pins.

### This Is Spiral Tap
Those bulk pack taps are called "hand taps" and they suck. If you scrap a part
with a broken tap, you're already worse off than if you'd just bought a good tap
in the first place.

Spend a few bucks on a Spiral Point or Spiral Flute tap.
I like spiral point, myself. You only need one, but buy two just in case.

### Drill Bits
 * 5/16"
 * \#29

### Reamers
You can use a drill bit in a pinch, but reamers are best.
 * 11/64"
 * 1/4"
 * 5/16"
 * 1/2"
 * \#39 or 2.5mm
 
#### Taps
 * \#8-32
 
| Thread | Tap Drill | Clearance Drill |
