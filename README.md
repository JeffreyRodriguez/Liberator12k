## Safety

DANGER - AT YOUR OWN RISK

Safety precautions and procedures *are not fully documented here*. Before you shoot any DIY gun from your hands **test
it first**.

* Use a secure test rig to hold the gun pointed in a **safe direction**.
* Stand behind a bulletproof barrier, such as several feet of dirt, concrete blocks, or very large tree.
* Ensure there is no direct path from the gun to anyone or anything of value.
* A string long enough to pull the trigger from behind cover.
* Test with at least 5 of the highest pressure cartridges you can find.
