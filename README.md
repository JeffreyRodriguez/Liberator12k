# Introduction

Welcome to the \#Liberator12k project.

This manual contains all the documentation for the weapons, ammunition,
and tools in the project. The first few chapters are a build guide: starting
with the Minuteman receiver then a CAFE12 break-action 12ga forend.
This is a good starting point - a simple, safe, affordable firearm.

The Minuteman receiver is reusable in several other configurations similar
to how you might swap AR15 uppers.

### Supporting the Project
This has been a one-man operation, ambitious from the start.
It's cost tens of thousands of dollars andyears of my time But now we have
a modular weapons platform, ammunition, and a suite of ECM tooling.
I dedicate it to the public domain to secure self-defense for everyone forever.

I didn't start this to get rich, but I wouldn't mind help. R&D doesn't pay the
bills it only comes with them.
I'd love to make new guns and ECM machines full-time, so if you want to show your
appreciation and help me continue this work here's a few ways you can help. 

### Liberator12k.com Store
The [Liberator12k.com Store](https://liberator12k.com/store/) has complete
hardware kits. All the hardware is fairly easy to source or fabricate yourself
if you have the equipment.

It would be trivial for someone to sell the same hardware kit.
I'm asking the community to support the official project by buying directly,
or from official vendors - check the website.
It's all public domain, so I'm counting on you to do the "encouraging".

Manufacturing is not my field and my time would be better spent in R&D.
I'm open to endorsing quality manufacturers and distributors for a royalty.
The requirements are straight forward good business. Contact me for more info.

### Donations
The [Donation page](https://liberator12k.com/donate.html) on the website
has info on how to donate with crypto and more.

I also have a [Patreon](https://patreon.com/liberator12k).

### Thank YOU
Prints are the greatest encouragement of all, I also love likes, shares, and
words of encouragement, criticism, and even hatred - if you're a hater.
It's fun doing this, but it's also nice to know other people appreciate it.
Thank you so much for joining me in this journey.

### International Builders
This is a US-based operation. I'm not presently shipping internationally.
That means I won't knowingly ship to a forwarder either, sorry!

Join the chat, there's other builders around the world. There's a metric version
but it's less well documented.

## How to Laugh at Danger
From behind a solid barrier - don't be stupid.
Everyone's a tough guy until they take a piece of shrapnel to the beanbag.

### Make at Your Own Risk
Any experienced printer can complete this build if they buy a kit from me.
I have done my best to make sure the designs included here are safe to the user
and bystanders. Designs that are in "Alpha" *may not be safe* to the user
**or bystanders.** Use extreme caution and two doses of common sense.

### Bystander Care
It's one thing if you hurt yourself, it's another if you hurt someone else.
The revolver will throw shot/wadding from the gap - at your range neighbors.
Keep bystanders behind you and maintain a safe "180 degree" line or
I'll shake *their* hand for kicking your ass, because you were warned.

### Basic Firearms Safety
 1. All guns are always loaded. 
 2. Never point the gun at anything you are not willing to destroy 
 3. Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on target and you have made the decision to shoot.
 4. Be sure of your target and what is beyond it.

### DIY Safety
DIY guns require special precautions and procedures that
*are not fully documented here*.

* Use a secure test rig to hold the gun pointed in a **safe direction**.
* Stand behind a bulletproof barrier, such as several feet of dirt, concrete blocks, or very large tree.
* Ensure there is no direct path from the gun to anyone or anything of value.
* A string long enough to pull the trigger from behind cover.
* Test with at least 5 of the highest pressure cartridges you can find.

### Gut Check
The power to create weapons is now in your hands, use it responsibly.

## Equipment
You print and can assemble the official kit with a few basic tools. Reamers for holes in the prints are recommended, but a drill bit will work too.

If you intend to DIY everything, you'll need a few more tools and equipment.
There's not a lot of "machining" required - a couple tapped holes in flat plate
and square rods. Contouring the recoil plate with a grinder would suck, but it
can be done.

I would strongly recommend a drill press if you're doing it all yourself, but
you can probably get by with some printed fixtures and jigs. Not ideal, but
but you can probably make it happen.

A cold saw or metal band saw are ideal for cutting the tubing and rods to size.
A lathe would be great for truing up pipes and tubes, but you can get by
with a grinder, belt/disc sander, or files in a pinch.

Some designs may require more advanced tooling, see that specific documentation
for more details.

### This Is Spiral Tap
Those bulk pack taps are called "hand taps" and they suck. If you scrap a part
with a broken tap, you're already worse off than if you'd just bought a good tap
in the first place.

Spend a few bucks on a Spiral Point or Spiral Flute tap.
I like spiral point, myself. You only need one, but buy two just in case.

### Metric and/or Inch
In general, here's how things go between inch and mm in this project:

| Purpose       | Inch    | Metric |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| Small pins    | 3/32"   | 2.5mm  |
| Medium Pins   | 1/4"    | 6mm    |
| Small Screws  | \#8-32  | M4     |
| Medium Screws | 1/4"-20 | M6     |
| Large Screws  | 1/2"-13 | 12mm   |
| Square Rods   | 1/4"    | 6mm    |

#### "Close Enough"
All the parts are inch-standard (or all-metric), but there are "close enough"
metric equivalents that are readily available even if you live in the US.

Sometimes it's easier and *much* cheaper to find certain parts in metric, that's
especially true for little stainless pins.
3/32" is just under 2.5mm, and a \#39 drill bit is just over 2.5mm.

### Drill Bits
 * 5/16"
 * \#29
 * \#39 or 2.5mm

### Reamers
You can use a drill bit in a pinch, but reamers are best.
 * 11/64" - \#8-32 Clearance
 * 1/4"
 * 5/16"
 * 1/2"
 * \#39 or 2.5mm
 
#### Taps
 * \#8-32
