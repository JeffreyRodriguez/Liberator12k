# Welcome to #Liberator12k project!

Reliable self-defense for everyone - forever.

### Quick Start
[Impatient or experienced? Go here.](Documentation/Quick Start.md)

### "What?" - Concept
Future-proof the individual's power to produce arms and ammunition.

#### Simplicity and Availability
Firearm operating mechanisms should be simple to understand and produce by
people with minimal tools and access to materials.

Ideally materials should be available from a brick and mortar hardware, grocery, and garden stores in cash. Home Depot, Ace, Tractor Supply, Lowes, Walmart, etc.

These stores do not carry alloy steel tubing suitable for pistol and rifle barrels. At best, Ace Hardware carries Grade 8 bolts which have excellent potential for
pistol barrels. Lots of quality metal is available on Amazon, Aliexpress, McMaster, Grainger, eBay, and OnlineMetals.

A printer and power drill are the only tools absolutely required. Drill bits and taps notwithstanding. A drill press will *greatly* simplify some processes.

#### Reuse and Upgrades
A driving force in \#Liberator12k weapon design is reuse of the same receiver.

Similar to the AR15 modular lower/upper concept, the L12k is conceptually split into receiver/forend.

One receiver, multiple forends. It remains to be seen if the fixed recoil plate design can accommodate pump and semiautomatic fire. It's perfect for a break-action and revolver.

#### DIY Tooling
The project took on a tooling aspect when Electrochemical Machining (ECM) entered the picture.

### "Why?" - Motivation


### "When?" - Timeline

### "Who?" - About the artist

### "How?" - Build your own

#### Minimum Safety Standard

DANGER - ART AT YOUR OWN RISK

Safety precautions and procedures *are not fully documented here*. Before you shoot a DIY gun from your hands **test it first**. You will need:

* A secure test rig to hold the gun pointed in a **safe direction**.
* A bulletproof barrier, such as several feet of dirt or very large tree.
* A string long enough to pull the trigger from behind cover.
* At least 5 of the highest pressure cartridges you can find.


Tech Levels
-----------
The original \#Liberator12k project goal was to design a safe and
functional shotgun from readily available parts, assembled with hand tools
and no drilling. I broke this no-drill rule twice - when safety *demanded* it;
I created drill-guides to aid in proper hole placement.

That original goal forbids many designs that are still very achievable for
anyone with a few power tools. As the project continues to grow, I will be
targeting advancing "tech levels", with a strong focus on simplicity and cost.

Tech Level One assumes you have the tools of Tech Level Zero.
A "Plus" tech level describes the 'better than minimal' tools for that level.

| Tech Level | Tools                                                           |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zero       | Metal Hacksaw, Metal Files,  Drill (hand or power), Hex wrenches|
| Zero Plus  | Cutoff Wheel, Bench Grinder, Drill Press, Bolt Cutters          |
| One        | 12v power supply (battery, charger, 3D printer, or lab supply)  |
| One Plus   | Lab power supply                                                |


Designing New Guns
---------------
The real "secret sauce" of this project, is the software library I developed
during the design process of these guns. I tried a lot of different ideas,
and what I came away with, is an OpenSCAD software library chock-full of
useful *configurable* objects.

If you browse through the code, you'll see the project has been grouped into
major functional areas:

  * Ammo - Printable Ammunition
  * Documentation - All sorts of docs; including barrel wall calculator.
  * Meta - 3D modeling-specific code
  * Receiver - Lower+Universal Receiver; interchangeable Forends
  * Tooling - Printable tools for gun making
  * Vitamins - Store-bought parts, nut and bolts, collars, etc.
  * Toys - Things I've tried and thrown away (maybe)

There are more directories than mentioned above, but this should give you a taste of what's in here.
