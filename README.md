# \#Liberator12k Manual

Get the latest code and kits at [Liberator12k.com](https://Liberator12k.com).

Self-defense is an individual imperative and weapons are the means of
self-defense. The guns are real and unstoppable.

* Don't hurt people who've done you no harm.
* Don't take or damage their stuff.
* This is for self-defense, sport, and fun.
* Be responsible when shooting.

### Warning: Alpha Release
It's *not done*. There *are definitely* bugs and rough edges.
Weapons may be incomplete and **unsafe** for you or **bystanders**.
Use extreme caution and two doses of common sense.

## The [Liberator12k.com](https://liberator12k.com/store/index.html) Store
The official store has complete hardware kits.
This one-man operation cost tens of thousands of dollars and hours invested.
I'm giving it away for free because I  want to support your ability to defend
yourself. I think that makes me safer, and the world better - on average.

I've made everything for the project easy to source yourself.
My kit costs around the same price you'd pay to buy *one* if you sourced all of
the parts yourself. I buy in bulk and the difference helps support the project.
It would be trivial for someone to come along and sell the same hardware kit.
I'm asking you - the community - to support the official project.
I didn't start this to get rich, but I wouldn't mind.

I don't need to be the guy selling kits. I'd much rather find trustworthy
distributors who I can endorse for a cut of the sales.
If you'd like to support the project as a vendor, get in touch.
You have to kick in and be *great* to customers or I'll drop you.

## Build a \#Liberator12k
Read the [Printing Guide](Printing.md) for slicer settings and material info.

[The Build Guide](ComeAndMakeIt.md) explains how to choose a model and build
all the different components for your very own \#Liberator12k.

## How to Laugh at Danger
From behind a solid barrier - don't be stupid.

Everyone's a tough guy until they take a piece of shrapnel to the beanbag.

### Make at Your Own Risk
I have done my best to make sure the designs included here are safe to the user
and bystanders. Designs that are in "Alpha" *may not be safe* to the user
**or bystanders.**

### Bystander Care
The revolver will throw shot/wadding from the gap - at your range neighbors.
Keep bystanders behind you and maintain a safe "180 degree" line or
I'll shake *their* hand for kicking your ass, because you were warned.

### Basic Firearms Safety
 1. All guns are always loaded. 
 2. Never point the gun at anything you are not willing to destroy 
 3. Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on target and you have made the decision to shoot.
 4. Be sure of your target and what is beyond it.

### Basic DIY Gun Safety
DIY guns require special precautions and procedures that
*are not fully documented here*.

* Use a secure test rig to hold the gun pointed in a **safe direction**.
* Stand behind a bulletproof barrier, such as several feet of dirt, concrete blocks, or very large tree.
* Ensure there is no direct path from the gun to anyone or anything of value.
* A string long enough to pull the trigger from behind cover.
* Test with at least 5 of the highest pressure cartridges you can find.

## Developers and Advanced Users
Want to customize a design to fit the materials you have on hand? Metric?
Change gauge or caliber completely, or something even more extreme?

The [Developer Docs](Developers.md) explain how to do all that and more.
