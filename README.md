# Introduction

Welcome to the \#Liberator12k project.
This manual will guide you through the build process.

## The [Liberator12k.com](https://liberator12k.com/store/) Store
The official store has complete hardware kits.
This one-man operation cost tens of thousands of dollars and hours invested.
I'm giving it away for free because I want to support your ability to defend
yourself. I think that makes me safer, and the world better overall.

All the hardware in the project is fairly easy to source yourself.
It would be trivial for someone to come along and sell the same hardware kit.
I'm asking you - the community - to support the official project.
I didn't start this to get rich, but I wouldn't mind a little support.

I don't need to be the guy selling kits. I'd much rather find trustworthy
distributors who I can endorse for a cut of the sales.
If you'd like to support the project as a vendor, get in touch.
You have to kick in to the project and be *great* to customers.

## How to Laugh at Danger
From behind a solid barrier - don't be stupid.

Everyone's a tough guy until they take a piece of shrapnel to the beanbag.

### Warning: Alpha Release
It's *not done*, there are bugs and rough edges.
Weapons may be incomplete and **unsafe** for you or **bystanders**.
Use extreme caution and two doses of common sense.

### Make at Your Own Risk
I have done my best to make sure the designs included here are safe to the user
and bystanders. Designs that are in "Alpha" *may not be safe* to the user
**or bystanders.**

### Bystander Care
The revolver will throw shot/wadding from the gap - at your range neighbors.
Keep bystanders behind you and maintain a safe "180 degree" line or
I'll shake *their* hand for kicking your ass, because you were warned.

### Basic Firearms Safety
 1. All guns are always loaded. 
 2. Never point the gun at anything you are not willing to destroy 
 3. Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on target and you have made the decision to shoot.
 4. Be sure of your target and what is beyond it.

### DIY Safety
DIY guns require special precautions and procedures that
*are not fully documented here*.

* Use a secure test rig to hold the gun pointed in a **safe direction**.
* Stand behind a bulletproof barrier, such as several feet of dirt, concrete blocks, or very large tree.
* Ensure there is no direct path from the gun to anyone or anything of value.
* A string long enough to pull the trigger from behind cover.
* Test with at least 5 of the highest pressure cartridges you can find.
