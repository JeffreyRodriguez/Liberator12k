## Post-Processing

### Install Heatset Nuts
Install the heatset nuts into Lower_Left.

### Pin Retainer
Locate the small hole in the Lower_MountRear.
Insert Lower Pin Retaining Pin, press it into the mount until flush.

### Subassembly
Requires the trigger from the [Fire Control Group](../FCG.md).

1. Lay Lower_Left flat-side up.
2. Install Lower_MountFront - the extended portion points left.
3. Install Lower_MountRear - the extended portion points left.
4. Tuck the trigger up between the two LowerMounts.
5. Add Lower_Middle to the stack.
6. Add Lower_Right, it should seat on the LowerMount tabs.
7. Gently compress the stack by hand.

If there are large gaps in the stack, light tapping with a rubber mallet should
close them. If you need a lot of force, there's probably something binding.
Figure out what's bulging, and file it down. Needle files are great for this.

## Technical Notes

### Trigger Pull
File, sand smooth, and lube any friction surfaces that are dragging.
