# 2: Choose Your Weapon

For your first build, make a CAFE12 break-action 12ga.
The CAFE12 is a great way to kick the tires on your Minuteman receiver build.

## Official Liberator12k.com Kits
The [\#Liberator12k.com store](https://liberator12k.com/store/) has complete
parts kits.
You can also obtain the required parts yourself,
just check the Bill of Materials for the build.

Your support is greatly appreciated, thank you!

## The Models
This list includes models that don't fit into the Universal Receiver system,
like BARBB.
Most of these forends can be mounted to the universal receiver without
modification.
