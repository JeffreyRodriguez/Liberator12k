# 2: Forends - Choose Your Weapon

### Your First Build

For your first build I recommend making a CAFE12 break-action 12ga.
Even if there's another design that caught your eye: The CAFE12 is training
wheels for the project and a great way to kick the tires on your receiver build.

### CAFE12 or CAFE12+
The **Plus** version uses 4130 tube instead of Schedule 40 pipe.
3/4" Schedule 40 pipes and 4130 tube are different sizes, so the
CAFE12 and CAFE12+ forends do not share parts.

The CAFE12 will be slightly cheaper, and you can easily source the parts from
your local hardware stores. 4130 tubing is *much* stronger than pipe, but you'll
have to purchase it from a metals supplier. Since it's stronger, machining is
harder as well - don't use a pipe cutter on 4130 tubing.

## The Models
This list includes models that don't fit into the Universal Receiver system,
like BARBB.
Most of these forends can be mounted to the universal receiver without
modification.

Just a reminder, the [Liberator12k.com Store](https://liberator12k.com/store/)
has complete parts kits if you don't want to source your own hardware.
Your support is greatly appreciated, thank you!

### CAFE12 Plus
This upgraded kit uses 4130 tubing instead of Schedule 40 pipe.

### CAFE12 Base
A CAFE12 break-action shotgun that uses Schedule 40 pipe instead of 4130 tube.
[2b: CAFE12 Forend](TopBreak_CAFE12.md) has the full details
about what pipes you need to buy and tips for how to prepare them.

### FP37
The FP37 was mostly "For Fun" and because it was an easy demonstration of how
flexible the \#Liberator12k platform can be.

[2c: FP37 Forend](TopBreak_FP37.md) will put a flare launcher
in your hands.

### ZZR6x12
Still a work-in-progress, but there's enough here that you could run a set of
prints. No guarantees that any of it'll work or even go together properly.
