# Build Part 2: Choose Your Weapon

For your first build, make a CAFE12 break-action 12ga.
The CAFE12 is a great way to kick the tires on your Minuteman receiver build.

## Official Liberator12k.com Kits
The [\#Liberator12k.com store](https://liberator12k.com/store/) has complete
parts kits.
You can also obtain the required parts yourself,
just check the Bill of Materials for the build.

Your support is greatly appreciated, thank you!

#### CAFE12 Plus
This upgraded kit uses 4130 tubing instead of Schedule 40 pipe.

Jump to [Build Part 2a: CAFE12+ Forend](Forend/TopBreak_CAFE12+.md)

#### CAFE12 Base
If you purchased a base kit you'll need to buy a pipe barrel.
[Build Part 2b: CAFE12 Forend](Forend/TopBreak_CAFE12.md) has the full details
about what pipes you need to buy and tips for how to prepare them.

#### FP37
The FP37 was mostly "For Fun" and because it was an easy demonstration of how
flexible the \#Liberator12k platform can be.

[Build Part 2c: FP37 Forend](Forend/TopBreak_FP37.md) will put a flare launcher
in your hands. Then you'll want to check out [Build Part 3](../Ammo/README.md)
for printable flare rounds!

## Complete Model List
This list includes models that don't fit into the Universal Receiver system,

modification.
