# 2b: CAFE12 Forend
![CAFE12 Forend Assembly](TopBreak_CAFE12/Assembly.jpg)

A 12ga [Top Break](TopBreak.md) variant based on the venerable pipe shotgun.

This **Plus** version uses 4130 tube instead of Schedule 40 pipe.
The *BarrelCollar* is not compatible between the CAFE12 and CAFE12+.
If you didn't buy a kit from the
[\#Liberator12k store](https://liberator12k.com/store/)
or are planning to build with Schedule 40 pipe, check out
[Build 2b: CAFE12](TopBreak_CAFE12.md).

This is the gun I set out to make when I started the project;
better than a slamfire in two big ways:
It has an extractor and a trigger.
Additionally, the barrel isn't a separate piece you need 3 hands to reload.
Since it's built with \#Liberator12k platform components it features:

* Optics-ready Picatinny Rail
* QD Sling
* MLOK
* Modular components
* Ambidextrous
