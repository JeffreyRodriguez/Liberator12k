### Schedule 40 Pipe
These Schedule 40 galvanized pipes are common in every single hardware store in
the United States. They'll be in the plumbing section, with a silvery finish.

#### 1" Pipe Nipples
"Pipe nipples" - they're just short pipes - tend to be smoother on the inside and will require less to not filing.

## Post-Processing
If you purchased a kit, all the machining is already done for you.

### Foregrip Cluster Heatset
Install the *Foregrip Bolt Nut* on the inside of the *Cluster*.

### Barrel Sleeve Machining
The *Barrel Sleeve* has several \#8-32 holes drilled along the top.
These holes are used to secure the *BarrelCollar* to the *Barrel Sleeve*
and the *Foregrip Cluster* to the *Barrel Sleeve* and *Barrel*.

#### DIY Fixture
**DO NOT DRILL THE BARREL**

A fixture located at `Forend/TopBreak_CAFE12/Fixtures/BarrelSleeveFixture.stl`
can be used to help you drill and tap your own *Barrel Sleeve*.

Using a \#8-32 tap, add threads to the hole in the middle.
Use a 1.5" \#8-32 to hold the *Barrel Sleeve* in place like a set screw.
Now you're ready to drill and tap the holes.

**DO NOT DRILL THE BARREL**

Drill the holes out with a \#29 wire bit, start out very slowly so the drill bit doesn't
walk on the round surface.Be sure to clear your chips early and often, use lots of cutting fluid.

Once you've finished drilling and tapping, ensure the inside of the *Barrel Sleeve* is
clear of any chips and debris.

#### Extractor Slot Machining
File out a 1/4" wide slot in the 6-O'clock position for the extractor bit.
Aim for a 45 degree angle 1/8" deep.

File this same notch in a matching location on the barrel. This is easiest
if you wait until you've installed the *Cluster*.

#### Latch Bars Machining
Drill and tap the the *Latch Rods* 1" from the end -

### Barrel Subassembly
Install the *Barrel* into the *Barrel Sleeve*, add the *Cluster* and *Foregrip*.
The *Foregrip Bolt Nut* and *Cluster Bolts* should act as set screws to secure
the *Barrel* into the *Barrel Sleeve*.

### Barrel Collar: Extractor Subassembly
1. Insert the *Extractor Bit* into the *Extractor*.
2. Drop the *Extractor Spring* into the *Barrel Collar*'s large rectangular hole.
3. Insert the *Extractor* into the hole, and install the *Extractor Retainer* from the large round hole for the barrel.

### Barrel Collar: Latch Subassembly
1. Insert the *Latch Springs* into the small square holes in the *Barrel Collar*.
2. Insert the *Latch Bars* into the square holes in the *Barrel Collar*.
3. Ensure the *Latch Bars* slide smoothly - file the holes if necessary.
4. Insert the two rectangular tabs of the *Latch* into the underside of the *Barrel Collar
5. Depress the *Latch Bars* while you install the *Latch Screws*.
6. Lube the slots and bars.

### Forend Subassembly
1. Rotate the *Barrel Collar* up into the *Forend*.
2. Install the Barrel with the sleeve
