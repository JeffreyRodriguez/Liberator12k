## Post-Processing

#### Stock Backplate
Insert the *Stock Pin Retaining Pin* into the back of the *Stock_Backplate*.

#### Buttstock
Insert the *Stock Buttpad Bolts* through the *Stock_Buttpad*, and screw
into the back of the *Stock Latch Subassembly*.


## Technical Notes

#### Stock Pin
The Universal Clevis Pin is simply an off-the-shelf item that works for the job.
A better, purpose-made pin can be easily made: 2x1/4" round rod.
Cut a small groove cut around the center to act as a detent for the
 *Stock Pin Retaining Pin*. This secures the pin in place.

#### Stock Pin Retaining Pin
I've used 3/32" music wire, 6D box nails, 2.5mm stainless wire.
It just needs to be about that size and about 2" long.

Drill out the hole in the *Stock_Backplate* to size, and hammer in your pin.
Add superglue to the last bit before you hammer it all the way in.
