## Platform Component: Stock

![Stock](Stock.png)

A stock and buttpad designed to fit the standard receiver.

The stock uses the threaded rods from the receiver - acorn nuts at the end of the stock are hidden behind the buttpad.

A latching mechanism keeps the buttpad on the stock - this secures the guts of the receiver in place. Remove the buttpad
to field strip the gun.
