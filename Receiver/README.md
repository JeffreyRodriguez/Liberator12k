# Build Part 1: Minuteman Receiver

![Minuteman](Assembly_Minuteman.jpg)

To get very technical, you're going to make a *Framed Receiver with a Stock*.
That's a mouthful, so I call it the
[Minuteman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutemen). It supports
most of the designs in the project.
This chonk has two big 1/2" bolts to support heavy forends.
Steel rods reinforce the receiver and stock.
A TPU buttpad reduces felt recoil.

There are other ways to configure the receiver,
but we'll save that for your second build.

## Printing

### Pick your colors
Two-tone is canon - that means it's official.

#### Spool 1: Base Color
We'll be using a full 1kg spool for the base color. Most of the "big" parts will
be printed with this filament.

#### Spool 2: Accent Color
The accent prints will take about 500kg of plastic, or half a typical spool.
Accent parts are often smaller and bear some kind of load, so if you want to
splurge - do it here.

#### Spool 3: TPU For Your Buttpad
The buttpad was designed to be TPU, it takes some of the sting out of the shot.

You may not find TPU that matches your base color, keep that in mind when you
choose your colors.
You can print the buttpad in any filament, but it may be more punishing than
necessary.
