# Build First: Universal Receiver

![Framed Universal Receiver](Assembly_FramedReceiver.jpg)

A complete \#Liberator12k is built from several modular parts.
The first part you need to build is a Universal Receiver.
You'd be right to think of this like an AR15 lower.
Most of the designs will work with this receiver.

The starter receiver configuration includes a stock, but other configurations
might be pistols or bullpups.
To get very technical, you're going to make a *Frame Receiver with a Stock*.
This chonky version has two big 1/2" bolts to support heavy Forends. The stock
has threaded rods running its length for added reinforcement.
There are other ways to configure the receiver, but save that for your second
build.

[Build Next: Choose Your Weapon](Forend/README.md) covers the different Forend designs
in detail. But for now, you need a receiver.

## The [Liberator12k.com Store](https://liberator12k.com/store/index.html)
The official store has complete hardware kits to make your life easy.

The goal is to be around the same price you'd pay to buy one if you sourced all
the parts yourself. I buy in bulk and the difference helps support the project.

This is a one-man operation and your support is greatly appreciated. I've made
everything for the project easy to source yourself, and it would be trivial for
someone to come
