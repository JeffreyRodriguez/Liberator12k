## How it Works
The sear is a square rod (Silver) with a cross-pin (SteelBlue) near the bottom.
An inclined slot in each side of the trigger (Olive) forces the cross-pin and
sear downward when the trigger is pulled. A central support tab (Chocolate)
keeps the sear and its return spring (not pictured) oriented vertically.

A compression spring located below the sear pushes the sear into the upward
position, driving the trigger forward via the sear pin.

#### Sear
 * 1/8" hole 5/16" from the bottom for the sear cross-pin
 * This hole should be drilled under-size and reamed if possible.
 * Filing any burrs is Good Enough.
 
#### Sear Cross-Pin
 * 3/32" Music Wire
 * 1/2" long
 * Ends should be slightly rounded and smooth.

## Instructions
All three parts of the trigger should be printed 100% solid.

### Glue Trigger Sides
![Trigger](Trigger_thumb.jpg)

The left and right trigger sides need to be permanently attached with super glue or epoxy

1. Verify the sear cross-pin will slide smoothly in the individual slots.
2. Apply glue to the raised portions of Trigger_Right
3. Set the left side on top of the right side.
4. Align the parts with straight edge (123 blocks).
5. Apply pressure to the left side plate for a good bond.

### Assembly
1. Insert the trigger middle portion into the glued sides. It should slide freely.
2. Drop the sear return spring into the trigger middle.
3. Insert the sear and and compress the return spring until the pin hole is visible through the side slot.
4. Insert cross-pin through the inclined slot through the sear. It should lay flush or just below the surface of the trigger sides.
5. Verify the trigger moves freely.
6. Oil the cross-pin hole, both sides of the slot, front and rear of the sear.
7. Squeezing the trigger should now feel silky smooth.

### Finishing
1. Polish and oil the sear surfaces and pin.
2. Sand/polish the friction surfaces of the trigger sides.
3. Use a needle file to clean up the inclined slot
