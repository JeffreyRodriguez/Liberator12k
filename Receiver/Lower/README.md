## Post-Processing

### Install Heatset Nuts
Install the heatset nuts into Lower_Left.

### Pin Retainer
Install 6D nail from the front to rear - the pointy end goes in the small hole.

### Subassembly
Requires the trigger from the [Fire Control Group](../FCG.md).

1. Lay Lower_Left flat-side up.
2. Install LowerMount_Front - the extended portion points left.
3. Install LowerMount_Rear - the extended portion points left.
4. Tuck the trigger up between the two LowerMounts.
5. Add Lower_Middle to the stack.
6. Add Lower_Right, it should seat on the LowerMount tabs.
7. Gently compress the stack by hand.

If there are large gaps in the stack, light tapping with a rubber mallet should
close them. If you need a lot of force, there's probably something binding. 
Figure out what's bulging, and file it down. Needle files are great for this.

## Technical Notes and Alternatives

### Trigger Pull
File, sand smooth, and oil any friction surfaces that are dragging.
