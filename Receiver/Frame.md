### Vitamins

Sear

  * 1/4" Steel Square Rod
  * 1.1525" long
  * 1/8" hole 5/16" from the bottom for the sear cross-pin
   * This hole should be drilled under-size and reamed if possible.
   * Filing any burrs is Good Enough.

Sear Cross-Pin

  * 1/8" Steel Round Rod
  * 1/2" long
  * Ends should be slightly rounded and smooth.

Sear Return Spring

  * 0.02" Wire
  * 0.25" OD
  * 1.25" Length
  * Sizes are approximate

## Instructions
### Welding Trigger Sides
The left and right trigger sides need to be permanently attached.

1. Verify the 1/8" sear cross-pin will slide smoothly in the slot.
2. Apply MEK or Acetone to the raised portions of the right trigger side.
3. Set the left side on top of the right side.
4. Align the parts with a 123 block, or similar in the back corner.
5. Apply pressure to the left side plate for a good bond.
6. Wait until dry before completing assembly.

### Assembly
1. From the top of the trigger sides, insert the trigger middle.
2. Install the sear return spring into the trigger middle.
3. Depress the sear return spring with the sear.
4. Insert cross-pin from the inclined slot through the sear.
5. Verify the trigger moves freely or use a needle file to clean up the slot
and/or cross-pin hole.
6. Oil the cross-pin hole, both sides of the slot, front and rear of the sear.
7. Squeezing the trigger should now feel silky smooth.
