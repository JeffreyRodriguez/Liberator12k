# 1.1: Large Frame Receiver

![Large Frame Receiver](Frame/Assembly_htmldoc.jpg)

This is the core of the gun. In the United States it's the receiver.
Legally-speaking it's a gun. If you need to dispose of it, burn it to ash.
Don't make one for a stranger - that's a Fed, especially if they're offering
money in exchange. Screenshot it and ridicule them online.

The *Large Frame Receiver* is the same as the standard *Receiver*, but with
two large (1/2") bolts support heavy forends.

## Post-Processing

### Install Tension Nuts
These four threaded inserts are installed in the front of the receiver.

Insert a threaded rod through the receiver from the rear and screw on the
threaded insert while you install the threaded inserts, this will help keep
them aligned.

### Install Rail Nuts
Insert a threaded rod through the receiver from the top and screw on the
threaded insert while you install the insert.

### Epoxy Acorn Nuts
The acorn nuts need to be permanently secured to the threaded rods
so you can actually unscrew them from the back.
Red threadlocker or 2-part epoxy are both good options.

### File/Sand Internal Surfaces
The smoother these surfaces, the nicer the gun will run. Mostly optional, print
at 0.1mm for better overall quality.
