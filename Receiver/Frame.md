# 1.1: Large Frame Receiver

![Large Frame Receiver](Preview_Frame.jpg)

This is the core of the gun. In the United States it's the receiver.
Legally-speaking it's a gun. If you need to dispose of it, burn it to ash.
Don't make one for a stranger - that's a Fed, especially if they're offering
money in exchange. Screenshot it and ridicule them online.

### Install Tension Nuts
These four threaded inserts are installed in the front of the receiver.

Insert a threaded rod through the receiver from the rear and screw on the
threaded insert while you install the threaded inserts, this will help keep
them aligned.

### Install Picrail Nuts
Insert a threaded rod through the receiver from the top and screw on the
threaded insert while you install the insert.


### File/Sand Internal Surfaces
The smoother these surfaces, the nicer the gun will run. Mostly optional, print
at 0.1mm for better overall quality.
