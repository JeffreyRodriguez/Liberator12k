### Install Tension Nuts
These four threaded inserts are installed in the front of the receiver.

Insert a threaded rod through the receiver from the rear and screw on the
threaded insert while you install the threaded inserts, this will help keep
them aligned.

### Install Picrail Nuts
Insert a threaded rod through the receiver from the top and screw on the
threaded insert while you install the insert.


### File/Sand Internal Surfaces
The smoother these surfaces, the nicer the gun will run. Mostly optional, print
at 0.1mm for better overall quality.
