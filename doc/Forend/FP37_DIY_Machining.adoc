=== Cut the Extractor Slot
File out a 1/4" wide slot in the 6-O'clock position for the extractor bit.
Aim for a 45 degree angle 1/8" deep.

File this same notch in a matching location on the barrel. This is easiest to do
with the *Trunnion* installed on the barrel so you can do both at once.
A large square-edged file makes quick work of this operation but you can also
use a Dremel or angle grinder (and a lot of finesse).

**Tip:** Use a vise.

=== Extractor Crescent
The extractor bit needs a crescent shaped cutout to go around the cartridge.
If you're making just one or two, check-and-fit until a cartridge chambers snugly without binding.

A Dremel with a cylindrical grinding bit works best for DIY.
Use a dummy cartridge.

=== Drill and Tap the Latch Bars
Drill and tap (#8-32) the *Latch Bars* 1" from the end
