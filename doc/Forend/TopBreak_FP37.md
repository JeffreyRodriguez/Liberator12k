## Post-Processing
If you purchased a kit, all the machining is already done for you.

### Foregrip Cluster Heatset
Install the *Foregrip Bolt Nut* on the inside of the *Cluster*.

#### Extractor Slot Machining
File out a 1/4" wide slot in the 6-O'clock position for the extractor bit.
Aim for a 45 degree angle 1/8" deep.

File this same notch in a matching location on the barrel. This is easiest
if you wait until you've installed the *Cluster*.

#### Latch Bars Machining
Drill and tap the the *Latch Rods* 1" from the end -

### Barrel Subassembly
Install the *Barrel* into the *Cluster* and *Foregrip*.
The *Foregrip Bolt Nut* and *Cluster Bolts* should act as set screws to secure
the *Barrel* into the *Trunnion*.

### Barrel Collar: Extractor Subassembly
1. Insert the *Extractor Bit* into the *Extractor*.
2. Drop the *Extractor Spring* into the *Barrel Collar*'s large rectangular hole.
3. Insert the *Extractor* into the hole, and install the *Extractor Retainer* from the large round hole for the barrel.

### Barrel Collar: Latch Subassembly
1. Insert the *Latch Springs* into the small square holes in the *Barrel Collar*.
2. Insert the *Latch Bars* into the square holes in the *Barrel Collar*.
3. Ensure the *Latch Bars* slide smoothly - file the holes if necessary.
4. Insert the two rectangular tabs of the *Latch* into the underside of the *Barrel Collar
5. Depress the *Latch Bars* while you install the *Latch Screws*.
6. Lube the slots and bars.

### Forend Subassembly
