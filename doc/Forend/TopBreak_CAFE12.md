# 2b: CAFE12 Forend
![CAFE12 Forend Assembly](TopBreak_CAFE12/Assembly_htmldoc.jpg)

A 12ga Top Break variant based on the venerable pipe shotgun.

This version uses Schedule 40 3/4" and 1" pipe.
Read the [Chapter 2a: CAFE12+ Forend](TopBreak_CAFE12+.md) for the
better, faster, stronger 4130 tube forend.

## Partial Kit
You can still buy a Partial CAFE kit from the [\#Liberator12k store](https://liberator12k.com/store/).

It has all the nuts, bolts, and custom parts already completed for you, just no barrel.
If you want to DIY everything, see [Appendix: Top-Break Common - Machining](TopBreak_Machining.md).

### Schedule 40 Pipe
These Schedule 40 galvanized pipes are common in every single hardware store in
the United States. They'll be in the plumbing section, with a silvery finish.

#### Pipe Seam
Pipes have a seam - this is not a good thing for many reasons, but it is what it is.
You'll have to file the seam out of the 3/4" pipe near the chamber area, and out of the entire 1" pipe.

#### 1" Pipe Nipples
"Pipe nipples" - they're just short pipes threaded on both ends.
They're more expensive per foot, but they tend to be smoother on the inside and will require less filing.
