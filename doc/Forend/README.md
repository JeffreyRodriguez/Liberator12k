# 2: Forends - Choose Your Weapon

### Your First Build

Your first build should be a CAFE12 break-action 12ga.
Even if there's another design that caught your eye, the CAFE12 is training
wheels for the project and a great way to kick the tires on your receiver build.

### CAFE12 or CAFE12+
The **Plus** version uses 4130 tube instead of Schedule 40 pipe.
3/4" Schedule 40 pipes and 4130 tube are different sizes, so the
CAFE12 and CAFE12+ forends do not share all parts.

The CAFE12 will be slightly cheaper, and you can easily source the parts from
your local hardware stores.
The pipe seam must be removed from the barrel, a large rat tail or half-round
file works nicely. This may take some WORK. Pipe seams suck and are sketchy.

The CAFE12+'s normalized 4130 tube is much stronger **and** seamless.
You'll have to purchase it from a metals supplier. Since it's stronger,
machining is harder as well - don't use a pipe cutter on 4130 tubing.

## The Models
This list includes models that don't fit into the Universal Receiver system,
like BARBB.
Most of these forends can be mounted to the universal receiver without
modification.

Just a reminder, the [Liberator12k.com Store](https://liberator12k.com/store/)
has complete parts kits if you don't want to source your own hardware.
Your support is greatly appreciated, thank you!

### CAFE12 Plus
This upgraded kit uses 4130 tubing instead of Schedule 40 pipe.

### CAFE12 Base
A CAFE12 break-action shotgun that uses Schedule 40 pipe instead of 4130 tube.
[2b: CAFE12 Forend](TopBreak_CAFE12.md) has the full details
about what pipes you need to buy and tips for how to prepare them.

### FP37
The FP37 was mostly "For Fun" and because it was an easy demonstration of how
flexible the \#Liberator12k platform can be. The parts list is almost identical
to the CAFE.

[2c: FP37 Forend](TopBreak_FP37.md) will put a flare launcher
in your hands.

### ZZR6x12
Still a work-in-progress, but there's enough here that you could run a set of
prints. No guarantees that any of it'll work or even go together properly.


### EVOLver
Very early in the design process. Reverse-pump belt-fed.
