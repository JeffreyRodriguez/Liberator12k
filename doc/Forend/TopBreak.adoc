==== Dry Function Test
WARNING: DO NOT LOAD THE WEAPON

TIP: The {model} is fairly heavy, the weight helps absorb recoil.
You will find it helpful to have a sling installed.
I suggest something with quick disconnects.

TIP: When discharged, the firing pin protrudes from the recoil plate.
You must charge the hammer before breaking the action.
Failure to do so will make the action harder or impossible to break open.
It may also damage the firing pin.

. Pull the charging handle back, the trigger should pop forward.
.. Now you should only feel stiff spring pressure at the final 1/4" of the charging handle travel.
.. This indicates the hammer is captured by the sear.
. Release the charging handle, then move it to the full forward position.
. With your dominant hand on the lower, press forward on the latch with that hand's pointer finger.
.. You may have to move your grip slightly out of position if you have small hands.
.. The latch should slide freely forward and back with only spring pressure holding it back.
.. This will unlatch the barrel.
. Rock the barrel down to break the action open.
.. The extractor will exert some pressure against breaking open the action.
.. You should not have to fight it.
. With your dominant hand on the lower, and your non-dominant hand on the vertical foregrip, close the action swiftly.
.. The latch bars should lock into the receiver front, securing the action closed.
. Pull the trigger, this will allow the hammer to drop.

WARNING: If there is any indication the sear is not *securely* capturing the
hammer, *do not proceed*. This is a dangerous condition.

<<<
==== Live Fire Test

WARNING: Keep the weapon pointed downrange while loading and testing.

. Charge the hammer
. Break the action open.
. Load a birdshot cartridge.
. Close the action.
. Aim in a safe direction, know what is behind your target.
. Fire the weapon.
.. If the shell does not go off, keep it pointed in a safe direction.
. Eject the spent shell.
. Inspect the weapon for damage.
.. Ensure the barrel has not moved relative to the trunnion - they should be flush.
. Repeat 4 more times with birdshot.
. Repeat this process with 00 buckshot, then slugs.
