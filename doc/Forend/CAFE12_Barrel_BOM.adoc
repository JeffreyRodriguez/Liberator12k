==== Schedule 40 Pipe
These Schedule 40 galvanized pipes are common in every single hardware store in
the United States. They'll be in the plumbing section, with a silvery finish.

===== Pipe Seam
Pipes have a seam - this is not a good thing for many reasons, but it is what it is.
You'll have to file the seam out of the 3/4" pipe near the chamber area, and out of the entire 1" pipe.

===== 1" Pipe Nipples
"Pipe nipples" - they're just short pipes threaded on both ends.
They're more expensive per foot, but they tend to be smoother on the inside and will require less filing.
