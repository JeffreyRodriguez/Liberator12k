== Introduction

Welcome to the Liberator12k project. Thank you for your interest.

This document will guide you through the build of a {model} top-break shotgun.

=== CAFE12+ vs CAFE12 Base
The CAFE12+ is the model I sell on the store, it uses 4130 tubing instead of
schedule 40 galvanized pipe.
4130 is a much stronger steel alloy, is seamless, and has tighter tolerances.
4130 is better, but galvanized pipe works too. The forend prints are not 100%
compatible since schedule 40 pipe is slightly larger than 4130.

TIP: This document is specific to the {model}.

=== Hardware Kit vs DIY
If you purchased a kit, all the machining is already done for you.

To DIY all the parts yourself, refer to the <<Minuteman DIY Machining>> and 
<<CAFE12 DIY Machining>> appendices.
The project includes several fixtures and jigs to assist you in DIY machining.

A fully outfitted shop with a lathe, mill, and drill press will produce the best
looking and most functional product.
But you can get by with hand tools, a drill, and an angle grinder.

=== Minuteman Receiver
The {model} uses the "Minuteman" universal receiver, a core component of many
designs in the Liberator12k family. Think of it like an AR15 lower receiver.
The Minuteman receiver is reusable in several other configurations similar
to how you might swap AR15 uppers. Forends mount on a pair of 1/2"-13 bolts.
This manual will guide you through building the Minuteman and {model} forend.
