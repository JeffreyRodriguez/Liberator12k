== Introduction

Welcome to the Liberator12k project. Thank you for your interest.

This document will guide you through the build of a CAFE12 top-break shotgun.

=== CAFE12+ vs CAFE12 Base
CAFE12+ is the model I sell on the store, it uses 4130 tubing instead of
schedule 40 galvanized pipe.
4130 is a much stronger steel alloy, is seamless, and has tighter tolerances.
4130 is better, but galvanized pipe works too. The forend prints are not 100%
compatible since schedule 40 pipe is slightly larger than 4130.

=== Minuteman Receiver
The CAFE12 uses the "Minuteman" universal receiver, a core component of many
designs in the Liberator12k family. Think of it like an AR15 lower receiver.
The Minuteman receiver is reusable in several other configurations similar
to how you might swap AR15 uppers. Forends mount on a pair of 1/2"-13 bolts.
This manual will guide you through building the Minuteman and CAFE12 forend.
