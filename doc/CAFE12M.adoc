== Introduction

Welcome to the Liberator12k project. Thank you for your interest.

This document will guide you through the build of a {model} top-break shotgun.

=== CAFE12M
Thanks to the parametric nature of the #Liberator12k, building a metric CAFE12
has proven surprisingly easy. You're going to have to source and fabricate all
your own hardware, but it's very doable.

TIP: This document is specific to the {model}.

=== Minuteman Receiver
The {model} uses the "Minuteman" universal receiver, a core component of many
designs in the Liberator12k family. Think of it like an AR15 lower receiver.
The Minuteman receiver is reusable in several other configurations similar
to how you might swap AR15 uppers. Forends mount on a pair of 1/2"-13 bolts.
This manual will guide you through building the Minuteman and {model} forend.
