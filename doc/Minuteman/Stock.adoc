A stock and buttpad designed to fit the standard receiver.

Four Tension Rods secure the stock to the Receiver.

A Stock Pin keeps the Stock_Backplate on the stock - this secures the guts
of the Receiver in place. Remove to field strip the gun.

===== Stock Backplate
. Heatset the _Stock Buttpad Nuts_ into the _Stock_Backplate_.
. Insert the *Stock Pin Retaining Pin* into the back of the _Stock_Backplate_.

===== Buttstock
. Insert the _Stock Buttpad Bolts_ through the _Stock_Buttpad_
. Assemble with the _Stock_Backplate_ and tighten bolts. Do not overtighten.

===== Stock Pin
Grind a small groove around the center of the pin to act as a detent.
This secures the pin in place.

===== Stock Pin Retaining Pin
I've used 3/32" music wire, 6D box nails, 2.5mm stainless wire.
It just needs to be about that size and about 2" long.

Drill out the hole in the *Stock_Backplate* to size, and hammer in your pin.
Add superglue near the head before you hammer it all the way in.
