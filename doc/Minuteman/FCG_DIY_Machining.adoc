== FCG DIY Machining

=== Sear
* 3/32" hole, 5/16" from the bottom for the sear cross-pin
* This hole should be drilled under-size and reamed if possible.
* Filing any burrs is Good Enough
* Chamfer both sides of the hole for best results.

=== Sear Cross-Pin
* 3/32" Music Wire
* 1/2" long
* Ends should be slightly rounded and smooth.
* I use 2.5x12mm pins in the official parts kits.

=== Firing Pin
* Cut the 6D box nail to 1.535" (39mm) overall length
* Cut generously, file flush.
* Gently round the tip with your file.
* Sand smooth with 220 grit or finer.

When fully assembled with recoil plate and receiver front, the firing pin must
protrude 3/32" or 2.5mm when the firing pin is depressed. It must be recessed
below the recoil plate when retracted.

If you find primers punctured, shave down the tip a bit at a time until it no
longer punctures primers. Too short and you will get "light strikes".

==== Instructions
The full How To is incomplete, but at a high level:

1. Print a Recoil Plate template (TODO).
2. Mark the holes with a punch and drill to specified size.
3. Tap the holes for the tension rods and FCG Housing holes with #8-32.
