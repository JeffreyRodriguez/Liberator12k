## DIY Hardware
If you don't want to purchase a kit from the
[Liberator12k.com Store](https://liberator12k.com/store/),
you can make your own. It won't be faster or cheaper, but all the information
you need is freely available and the hardware is available at your local
hardware store or metal supplier.
