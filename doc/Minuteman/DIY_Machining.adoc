== Minuteman DIY Machining

=== You know I sell kits, right?
You can do this all yourself, but I also sell kits on the
https://liberator12k.com/store/[Liberator12k.com Store].
It won't be faster or cheaper to DIY, but all the information
you need is freely available and the hardware is available at your local
hardware store or metal supplier.

DIY-ability is by design, for your benefit. Thanks for considering the store,
but if you prefer to DIY I understand and fully support your decision.
At this time DIY hardware is not fully documented.

=== Incomplete Documentation Ahead
This portion of the documentation is incomplete, contributions are welcome.

Check out the https://github.com/JeffreyRodriguez/Liberator12k/wiki/DIY-Machining[GitHub Wiki] page on DIY machining.
It's a work in progress, but at least gives a place for the community to work on
helping with documentation between releases.
