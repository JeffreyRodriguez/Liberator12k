== "Minuteman" Receiver

.Minuteman Receiver Assembly
image::../.views/Assembly_Minuteman_{units}/Assembly.png[]

To get very technical this is a *Large Frame Receiver with a Stock*.
That's a mouthful, so I call it the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutemen[Minuteman].
It works with most of the designs in the project.

Each Minuteman component has its own subsection, print them in order.

=== Preparing to Print

Pick Your Colors. Two-tone is canon - that means it's official.

==== Spool 1: Base Color
We'll be using a full 1kg spool for the base color. Most of the "big" parts will
be printed with this filament.

==== Spool 2: Accent Color
The accent prints will take about 500g of plastic, or half a typical spool.
Accent parts are often smaller and bear some kind of load, so if you want to
splurge - do it here.

==== Spool 3: TPU For Your Buttpad
You can print the buttpad in any filament, but it may be more punishing than
necessary. TPU will absorb some recoil.

==== Configure Cura and Preheat
Configure Cura according to the <<General Printing Guidelines>> in the
Introduction and slice each part for printing.

The models are already in the proper orientation for printing, so leave the
bottom side down.
You are free to position them on the build plate however you like.

Printing one part at a time will produce higher quality prints,
but it will take longer.
