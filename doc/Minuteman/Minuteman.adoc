== The "Minuteman" Receiver

.Minuteman Receiver Assembly
image::../.views/Preview_Minuteman.png[]

To get very technical this is a *Large Frame Receiver with a Stock*.
That's a mouthful, so I call it the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutemen[Minuteman].
It works with most of the designs in the project.
There are other ways to configure the receiver,
but we'll save that for a future build.

=== Components
Each of the following components has its own subsection.
Familiarize yourself with figures 1-5, this is your map.

You can complete these components in any order and assemble them all at the end.
The trigger must be assembled before the lower, since it's "captured".

* Large Framed Receiver
* Fire Control Group (FCG)
* Lower
* Stock

.Large Framed Receiver
image::../src/Receiver/.assembly/Frame.png[]
This is "the gun" in the US. I can sell you everything **except** one of these.
It's just one marathon print - almost two days at 0.4mm or just 20h at 1.0mm.

.Fire Control Group
image::../src/Receiver/.assembly/FCG.png[]
Abbreviated "FCG" - the most involved of all the components.
Literally all the moving parts are here.

.Lower
image::../src/Receiver/.assembly/Lower.png[]
The grip for the gun, also holds the trigger from the FCG.

.Stock
image::../src/Receiver/.assembly/Stock.png[]
A spacer and buttpad for your receiver. Another of the major prints that will
benefit greatly from a large nozzle.

=== Preparing to Print

Pick Your Colors. Two-tone is canon - that means it's official.

==== Spool 1: Base Color
We'll be using a full 1kg spool for the base color. Most of the "big" parts will
be printed with this filament.

==== Spool 2: Accent Color
The accent prints will take about 500g of plastic, or half a typical spool.
Accent parts are often smaller and bear some kind of load, so if you want to
splurge - do it here.

==== Spool 3: TPU For Your Buttpad
You can print the buttpad in any filament, but it may be more punishing than
necessary. TPU will absorb some recoil.

==== Configure Cura and Preheat
Configure Cura according to the <<General Printing Guidelines>> in the
Introduction and slice each part for printing.

The models are already in the proper orientation for printing, so leave the
bottom side down.
You are free to position them on the build plate however you like.

Printing one part at a time will produce higher quality prints,
but it will take longer.
