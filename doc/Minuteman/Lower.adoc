==== Post-Processing

===== Install Heatset Nuts
Install the heatset nuts into Lower_Left.

===== Pin Retainer
Locate the small hole in the Lower_MountRear.
Insert Lower Pin Retaining Pin, press it into the mount until flush.

===== Subassembly
Requires the trigger from the [Fire Control Group](../FCG.md).

. Lay Lower_Left flat-side up.
. Install Lower_MountFront - the extended portion points left.
. Install Lower_MountRear - the extended portion points left.
. Tuck the trigger up between the two LowerMounts.
. Add Lower_Middle to the stack.
. Add Lower_Right, it should seat on the LowerMount tabs.
. Gently compress the stack by hand.

If there are large gaps in the stack, light tapping with a rubber mallet should
close them. If you need a lot of force, there's probably something binding.
Figure out what's bulging, and file it down. Needle files are great for this.

==== Technical Notes

===== Trigger Pull
File, sand smooth, and lube any friction surfaces that are dragging.
