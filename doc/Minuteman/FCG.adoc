.Fire Control Group

A fire control group for fixed recoil plate designs. Trigger is based on
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNR0HGw5airGKkiPcquS0TA[The Unknown Cat's]
design.

The sear is a square rod with a cross-pin near the bottom.
An inclined slot in each side of the trigger forces the cross-pin and
sear downward when the trigger is pulled. A central support tab
keeps the sear and its return spring (not pictured) oriented vertically.

A compression spring located below the sear pushes the sear into the upward
position, driving the trigger forward via the sear pin.

A linear hammer strikes the firing pin, which protrudes through the recoil plate.

==== Post-Processing

===== Trigger Subassembly

. Insert the _TriggerMiddle_ into the _Trigger_. It should slide freely.
. Drop the _Sear Return Spring_ into the _TriggerMiddle_.
. Insert the _Sear_ and compress the _Sear Return Spring_.
. Insert _SearPin_ through the inclined slot in the _Trigger_, and through the _Sear_.
. Verify the trigger moves freely.
. Lube the cross-pin hole, both sides of the slot, front and rear of the sear.

===== Hammer Subassembly
. Heatset the _Hammer Nut_ into the rear of the _Hammer_.
. Install the _Hammer Bolt_.
. Slip the _Hammer Bolt Sleeve_ over the extended portion.
. Add the _Hammer Spring_ and _Hammer Tail_.
. Install the _Hammer Cap Nut_ with threadlocker.

===== Firing Pin Subassembly
. Ream the _Firing Pin Collar* hole to 2.5mm.
. Install the _Firing Pin_ into the round end of the _FiringPinCollar_.

===== Charging Handle
. Heatset the _Charging Handle Nut_ into the _ChagingHandle_.
. Chuck the _Charging Handle Bolt_ in a drill and file/sand the bolt cap smooth.
. Install the _Charging Handle Bolt_ into the bottom of the _ChargingHandle_.
