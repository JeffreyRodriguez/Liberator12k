The sear is a square rod with a cross-pin.
An inclined slot in the trigger forces sear downward when the trigger is pulled.
With the sear lowered, the linear hammer can move forward striking the firing pin.
When the charging handle is pulled a return spring pushes the sear upward.

==== Post-Processing

===== Trigger Subassembly

.Trigger X-Ray
image::../.views/Receiver/FCG_{units}/XRay_Assembly.png[]

. Insert the _TriggerMiddle_ into the _Trigger_. It should slide freely.
. Drop the _Sear Return Spring_ into the _TriggerMiddle_.
. Insert the _Sear_ and compress the _Sear Return Spring_.
. Insert _SearPin_ through the inclined slot in the _Trigger_, and through the _Sear_.
. Verify the trigger moves freely.
. Lube the cross-pin hole, both sides of the slot, front and rear of the sear.

===== Hammer Subassembly

.Hammer X-Ray

. Heatset the _Hammer Nut_ into the rear of the _Hammer_.
. Install the _Hammer Bolt_.
. Slip the _Hammer Bolt Sleeve_ over the extended portion.
. Add the _Hammer Spring_ and _Hammer Tail_.
. Install the _Hammer Cap Nut_ with threadlocker.

. Ream the _Firing Pin Collar_ hole to 2.5mm.
. Add superglue near the nail head.
. Install the _Firing Pin_ into the round end of the _FiringPinCollar_.

TIP: Do not assemble this component yet, you will be directed how in the
model-specific documentation.

The firing pin housing screws into the back of the recoil plate, through a
_ReceiverFront_ part.

ifndef::fcg-disconnector[]
The {model} does not use the disconnector,
it is mentioned here for reference only.

. Heatset the _Charging Handle Nut_ into the _ChagingHandle_.
. Chuck the _Charging Handle Bolt_ in a drill and file/sand the bolt cap smooth.
. Install the _Charging Handle Bolt_ into the bottom of the _ChargingHandle_.
