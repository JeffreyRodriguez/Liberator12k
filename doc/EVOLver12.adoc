== Introduction

Welcome to the Liberator12k project. Thank you for your interest.

This document will guide you through the build of a {model} top-break shotgun.

=== EVOLver - Belt Fed Pump
The EVOLver is an _early prototype_, designed to fire 12ga from a printed belt.

Docs are very incomplete, join the chat to help move the ball on this design.

=== Hardware Kit vs DIY
If you purchased a kit, all the machining is already done for you.

To DIY all the parts yourself, refer to the <<Minuteman DIY Machining>> and
<<EVOLver DIY Machining>> appendices.
The project includes several fixtures and jigs to assist you in DIY machining.

A fully outfitted shop with a lathe, mill, and drill press will produce the best
looking and most functional product.
But you can get by with hand tools, a drill, and an angle grinder.

=== Minuteman Receiver
The {model} uses the "Minuteman" universal receiver, a core component of many
designs in the Liberator12k family. Think of it like an AR15 lower receiver.
The Minuteman receiver is reusable in several other configurations similar
to how you might swap AR15 uppers. Forends mount on a pair of 1/2"-13 bolts.
This manual will guide you through building the Minuteman and {model} forend.
