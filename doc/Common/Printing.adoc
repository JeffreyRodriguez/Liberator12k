== General Printing Guidelines
Unless otherwise stated, every print will use these settings.
Most parts are good with a thick shell and low infill.

If a part needs to be printed solid, the build guide will have a note for you.
Increase your infill to 100% for these parts.

=== Compatible Materials
PLA, PLA+, ABS, PETG, Nylon, PC, POM - almost anything.
The strength is in the steel.

Check your parts for shrinkage and scale them appropriately in your slicer if
necessary. I've been using eSun PLA+ for reference size.
I often scale ABS to 100.8%, but taller layers shrink more.
Your mileage may vary.

==== Printing with TPU
The buttpad was designed to be printed with "95D" TPU filament to absorb recoil.

95D TPU will run in a stock Ender 3. Lower than 95D is more flexible, and not
advised as it requires printer modifications not documented here.

You may not find TPU that matches your base color, keep that in mind when you
choose your colors.

Just select *Generic TPU* for the material in Cura.

=== Print Settings
These are the only vital Cura settings to override.

.Shell
* Wall Thickness: 3mm
* Top/Bottom Thickness: 3.2mm
* Filter Out Tiny Gaps: Yes _reduces large-nozzle drool_
* Z Seam Alignment: Sharpest Corner

.Support
* Generate Support: Yes
* Support Structure: Tree
* Support XY Distance: 1.3mm

==== About Layer Heights
0.2mm layers are a good balance between speed and quality.

0.1mm layers will look 50% better and take twice as long.

You can *probably* print any of the large parts with layers >0.2mm high.
This is especially true with larger nozzles.
You should expect the tolerances to change because the material shrinkage will
be greater.

Smaller parts, notably the small Fire Control Group parts should be printed with
standard layer heights. Small parts usually have tighter tolerance requirements
and taller layers may cause binding. 0.1mm layers will only help here.

=== #FatNozzleGang
All print times are given for 0.4mm nozzles at 0.2mm layer height.

The Fire Control Group (FCG) will benefit most from smaller nozzles, print these
parts first and then go ahead and swap to a 1.0 (or something in between).

Increasing nozzle diameter yields exponential speed gains. Since you gain so
much speed from a larger nozzle, you can slow down your print speed and use
lower layer heights for better print quality - and *still* be faster than stock.

Almost everything can be printed with a 1.5mm nozzle;
0.4mm works too - it just takes a lot longer.
