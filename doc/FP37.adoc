== Introduction

Welcome to the Liberator12k project. Thank you for your interest.

This document will guide you through the build of a {model} top-break shotgun.

=== FP37 - It's not a weapon
The "Flare Projector" 37mm is a signaling device, not a weapon.
Depending on what you load into it, it might become a weapon, so take care with
your ammunition and loadings.

=== Hardware Kit vs DIY
If you purchased a kit, all the machining is already done for you.

To DIY all the parts yourself, refer to the <<Minuteman DIY Machining>> and 
<<FP37 DIY Machining>> appendices.
The project includes several fixtures and jigs to assist you in DIY machining.

A fully outfitted shop with a lathe, mill, and drill press will produce the best
looking and most functional product.
But you can get by with hand tools, a drill, and an angle grinder.

=== Minuteman Receiver
The {model} uses the "Minuteman" universal receiver, a core component of many
designs in the Liberator12k family. Think of it like an AR15 lower receiver.
The Minuteman receiver is reusable in several other configurations similar
to how you might swap AR15 uppers. Forends mount on a pair of 1/2"-13 bolts.
This manual will guide you through building the Minuteman and {model} forend.
