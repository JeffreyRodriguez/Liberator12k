# History of the Project

## A Modular DIY Weapons Platform
A driving force in \#Liberator12k weapon design is reuse of the same receiver.

Similar to the AR15 modular lower/upper concept, the L12k is conceptually split into receiver/forend.

### Built-in Customization
The real "secret sauce" of this project, is the software library I developed
during the design process of these guns. I tried a lot of different ideas,
and what I came away with, is an OpenSCAD software library chock-full of
useful *configurable* gun parts.

If you browse through the code, you'll see the project has been grouped into
major functional areas.

  * Ammo - Printable Ammunition
  * Receiver - Lower+Universal Receiver
  * Forends - Interchangeable forends for the receiver
  * Tooling - Printable tools for gun making
  * Vitamins - Store-bought parts, nut and bolts, collars, etc.
  * Toys - Things I've tried and thrown away (maybe)

#### Simplicity and Availability
Firearm operating mechanisms should be simple to understand and produce by
people with minimal tools and access to materials.

Ideally materials should be available from a brick and mortar hardware, grocery, and garden stores in cash. Home Depot, Ace, Tractor Supply, Lowes, Walmart, etc.

These stores do not carry alloy steel tubing suitable for pistol and
rifle barrels. At best, Ace Hardware carries Grade 8 bolts which have excellent
potential for pistol barrels. Lots of quality metal is available on
Amazon, Aliexpress, McMaster, Grainger, eBay, and OnlineMetals.

A printer and power drill are the only tools absolutely required.
Drill bits and taps notwithstanding.
A drill press will *greatly* simplify some processes.

## DIY Tooling
The project took on a tooling aspect when Electrochemical Machining (ECM)
entered the picture.

## Tech Levels
The original \#Liberator12k project goal was to design a safe and
functional shotgun from readily available parts, assembled with hand tools
and no drilling. I broke this no-drill rule twice - when safety *demanded* it;
I created drill-guides to aid in proper hole placement.

That original goal forbids many designs that are still very achievable for
anyone with a few power tools. As the project continues to grow, I will be
targeting advancing "tech levels", with a strong focus on simplicity and cost.

Tech Level One assumes you have the tools of Tech Level Zero.
A "Plus" tech level describes the 'better than minimal' tools for that level.

| Tech Level | Tools                                                           |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zero       | Metal Hacksaw, Metal Files,  Drill (hand or power), Hex wrenches|
| Zero Plus  | Cutoff Wheel, Bench Grinder, Drill Press, Bolt Cutters          |
| One        | 12v power supply (battery, charger, 3D printer, or lab supply)  |
| One Plus   | Lab power supply                                                |

# Why
Is for you to understand and decide for yourself. Some thoughts that have influenced me:

> A man's natural rights are his own, against the whole world; and any infringement of them is equally a crime; whether committed by one man, or by millions; whether committed by one man, calling himself a robber, or by millions calling themselves a government.

Lysander Spooner, No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority

> My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs) - or to 'unconstitutional' Monarchy. I would arrest anybody who uses the word State (in any sense other than the inanimate realm of England and its inhabitants, a thing that has neither power, rights nor mind); and after a chance of recantation, execute them if they remained obstinate! If we could get back to personal names, it would do a lot of good. Government is an abstract noun meaning the art and process of governing and it should be an offence to write it with a capital G or so as to refer to people. If people were in the habit of referring to 'King George's council, Winston and his gang', it would go a long way to clearing thought, and reducing the frightful landslide into Theyocracy.

The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, pg. 74, Letter 52.

> And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn't love freedom enough. And even more - we had no awareness of the real situation.... We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.
