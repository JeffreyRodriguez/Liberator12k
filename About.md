# 5. Why

It is the imperative of every living thing to defend itself.

That means: it's up to you to fight back when something tries to eat you.
Get help if you can, but sometimes no help is coming.

I hope this project is a light for you in dark times.

## No Step

Rosebushes and rattlesnakes get along like hemlock and honeybees.
The Golden Poison Dart Frog's skin is so deadly it can kill over a dozen adults.
But they'd all have to touch it.

Go in peace and prosper. Lets trade stories, food, goods, and good times.

Don't fuck with me, and I won't fuck with you.

Life is an evolutionary arms race, and it's complicated.
Do you think it's a good idea to be armed?

## Bigger Fish to Fry
States run like mindless machines. Code written by lawyers, run on flawed human
beings each doing their own small task. Its ultimate tool: violence - to death.
 
The great [democides](https://en.wikipedia.org/Democide) and
[wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll)
have shown the need for individuals to be armed.

If it comes to that, you might die complying anyway. So be like a honeybee, and
fight like hell anyway.

The second greatest danger to human prosperity and life is the order giver.
Stalin, Hitler, and Mao never personally murdered anyone.
Neither did Charles Manson or Jim Jones for that matter.

The greatest danger is the unquestioning order-follower.
Nothing more than a cog in a machine.

 1. Enforce the current government's current laws, even if they are atrocious.
 2. Fight the current government's enemies, even if manufactured or imagined.

### What About Mass Shooters?
Most definitions of "mass shooting" use something along the lines of 3+ people.

States have body counts in the tens of millions, with precedents in living memory.
When a state is murdering it's own people, that's a Tuesday morning... so
routine and monotonous that they make up sick games to spice things up.

### What About Terrorists?
The US Government gave them billions of dollars worth of equipment way better
than this when it left Afghanistan.

#### What About Tanks and Nukes?
Read up a bit on [Guerrilla Warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare) tactics.

### Some other thoughts of others

> A man's natural rights are his own, against the whole world; and any infringement of them is equally a crime; whether committed by one man, or by millions; whether committed by one man, calling himself a robber, or by millions calling themselves a government.

Lysander Spooner, No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority

> And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn't love freedom enough. And even more - we had no awareness of the real situation.... We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.

> My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs) - or to 'unconstitutional' Monarchy. I would arrest anybody who uses the word State (in any sense other than the inanimate realm of England and its inhabitants, a thing that has neither power, rights nor mind); and after a chance of recantation, execute them if they remained obstinate! If we could get back to personal names, it would do a lot of good. Government is an abstract noun meaning the art and process of governing and it should be an offence to write it with a capital G or so as to refer to people. If people were in the habit of referring to 'King George's council, Winston and his gang', it would go a long way to clearing thought, and reducing the frightful landslide into Theyocracy.
