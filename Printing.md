## Print Guide

General printing instructions that apply to \#Liberator12k designs.

### Standard Print Settings
Unless otherwise stated, these are the only vital slicer values to set.

  * 0.4-1.5mm nozzle
  * 0.2mm layers
  * 3mm walls
  * 4mm top and bottom
  * 20% infill

0.1mm layers will take twice as long, but look 20% better.

### Acceptable Materials
PLA, PLA+, ABS, PETG, and Nylon should all work fine. The strength is in the steel.

### A note on print time and nozzle diameter
Some prints need a smaller (standard) size nozzle, like 0.4mm but generally:
larger nozzles are recommended for time savings.

If I was you: 0.8mm nozzle and 0.1mm layers. Print the FCG components first,
then do the swap.
