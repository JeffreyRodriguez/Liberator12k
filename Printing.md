## Print Guide
General printing instructions that apply to \#Liberator12k designs.

### Print Settings
Unless otherwise stated, these are the only vital slicer values to set.

  * 0.4-1.5mm nozzle
  * 0.2mm layers
  * 3mm walls
  * 4mm top and bottom
  * 20% infill

#### Layer Height
0.2mm layers should work fine, but you'll get better quality printing at 0.1mm.
0.1mm layers will take twice as long, so I recommend using a larger nozzle for
the bigger prints.

### Materials
PLA, PLA+, ABS, PETG, and Nylon should all work fine. The strength is in the steel.

### Nozzle
Some prints need a standard size nozzle ~0.4mm, mostly the FCG parts.
For everything else, larger nozzles are recommended for time savings.
0.4mm will work just fine, but it'll take longer than it has to.

Print the FCG components first with 0.4mm, then swap to a 0.8mm nozzle - it's 4x
faster.
